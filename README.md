# Working Local

If one is working on the theming or any new features that needs double-checking on how Jekyll compiled it, it's encouraged to spin this up locally and test. It's easy!

## Requirements

- `bundle` - Ruby Dependency Manager (install with `gem install bundler` - may require `sudo`)

## Setup

```bash
bundle install
```

## Usage

Compile, serve, & watch:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:4000>

Other commands:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll --help
```
